## 📄 AWS-Driven Automated Receipt Workflow

Processing receipts manually can be ⏳ slow, ❌ error-prone, and 📈 hard to manage at scale.  
This project automates the receipt processing pipeline using **AWS cloud services** for seamless 📝 extraction, 💾 storage, and 📢 notification — minimizing manual effort.

Instead of doing manual data entry, the system transforms 🖼️ receipt images or 📑 PDFs into **structured data**, then stores it for efficient 🗃️ **record-keeping and auditing**.

## 🧠 Project Motivation

Whether you’re handling data for a 🏢 company, 🎓 college finances, or 🎫 event reimbursements, streamlining receipt workflows brings:

- 🎯 Precision  
- ⚡ Fast turnaround  
- 📊 Scalable operations  
- 📬 Instant email alerts

## 🏗️ System Blueprint

The architecture is divided into functional layers — each managed by a dedicated AWS service:

### 📦 Storage Layer
- **Amazon S3**  
  💾 Safely stores uploaded receipt files (images or PDFs).

### 🧾 Extraction Layer
- **Amazon Textract**  
  🧠 Employs **AI-powered OCR** to pull text and structured information.

### 🗃️ Database Layer
- **Amazon DynamoDB**  
  📂 Captures and stores the extracted data in a scalable NoSQL database.

### 📧 Notification Layer
- **Amazon SES (Simple Email Service)**  
  📢 Emails processed receipt details to users or admins.

### ⚙️ Processing Layer
- **AWS Lambda**  
  🤖 Orchestrates workflows automatically when new receipts are uploaded.
